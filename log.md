Daniel:
- Added the WSG end-effector to a seperate URDF, transmission and Gazebo file.
- Added a launch file in ur5_controllers, which launches the UR5 with the WSG end-effector.
- The .dae - visual - files does not work for the WSG end-effector, so one might add them later, for now there is used .stl files
